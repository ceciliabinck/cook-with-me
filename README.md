Growing up me and my siblings learned how to cook at an early age, starting with some basic dishes. So when I was older and going to school I always found it strange that most of my classmate could not cook. When I would ask them about that they would say that there, mostly, mother cooked or they had not learned to cook and take out is way faster. Cooking is not that difficult if only I could help them figure that out.

When I finished school I decided to travel instead of study on and starting to work like all my classmates. While travelling I saw new cultures and new exiting foods and no idea how to make them. I made new friends from all over the world and I got to try some of there favourite dishes. I have asked how to make some of those dishes but I was not able to remember all of them and I did not have anywhere to write them down in a save place.

# UX

## Project Goals

# Wireframes

I built the wireframes for this project using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>. First I started by making a design for the desktop version, which I then translated to mobile/tablet version of the same design. I am not sure yet if I should create a different design for tablet mode as nowadays you have many different sizes for tablets. To get a better understanding of how the elements will be structured on the page.

# Design Choices

The theme of this project is food and there are a lot of websites like the one I am making for this project. So I wanted to do some research to see if there was anything that I could put in my design to make my website more appealing to users. And that would make users more likely to try and make some of the different recipes on my website.

## Fonts

I also looked into the effects of different fonts and I found an article that talked about scientific facts about fonts. It states that "Experiments show that people are more likely to believe information set in Baskerville". People see Baskerville as a trustworthy font. So that would hopefully mean that users would be more likely to choose my website over another one. As there is a lot of competition in the segment.

So I went to look for this trustworthy font on Google fonts, turns out it is not available there. So for my primary font, I went for the next best thing on Google fonts **Libre Baskerville**. I decided to go with Regular 400. As the bold 700 would make it harder to read and the regular 400 italic could make it harder to follow instructions. As fact 3 in that same article says "The same researchers found that when people were given a task, those who got fancy fonts estimated the task would take nearly twice as long." I would not want to scare users off because they think the recipes take longer than the estimated time.

The second font I wanted to be a bit fancier to draw users eyes to it. According to fact number 2 in this article "Fancier fonts are associated with more skill in certain professions; in one study, diners who received menus with fancy fonts assumed the chef had more skill."

It cost me some time to find because I had to look through all 999 different family font, where I found 6 that I liked. After that, I had to test the different fonts with my primary font. In the end, I choose for the font family **Playball** as my second font, even though I find it a bit too bold. 

### Changes

After putting the different font families on the page and working with it for a couple of days. I found out I did not like the **Libre Baskerville** at all. The two fonts did not match well in the end either. In the beginning, I was not sure about the **Playball** font but in the end, I liked it a lot. So I have decided to change the main font family. I choose to look at the pairing section on google fonts and decided on a font that I have already used before **Roboto**. They are a bit similar but **Playball** is more elegant. So I still have a simple and elegant font but with a similar base.

## Colours

I looked into which colours would make people more likely to give them an appetite. From all the different articles that I have read, I found out that the colours yellow, orange, green and red stimulate most peoples appetite. In some articles, they also name the colour turquoise because it's often connected to happiness and the feeling of being carefree. 
The colours orange and yellow are the 2 that are seen as the colours that mostly only have positive effects on your appetite. 

- Yellow:
The colour yellow makes most people very happy. When people are happy, they are more likely to eat than when they are feeling sad or overly calm.

- Orange:
Orange is a colour that makes people feel welcome and when someone is comfortable, eating sounds like a great idea.

As for the colours red and green, they have a positive effect but they can also have an increasing effect on your appetite. 

- Green:
Many people are attracted to the colour green and associated it with abundance. This is a good colour to promote healthy eating and lots of it. Some people associate green vegetables with a bitter or sour taste. The colour green also has a calming effect and would help with eating a satisfying meal

- Red:
The colour red raises a person’s blood pressure, heart rate, and causes hunger to be more prevalent. Bit if you eat from a red plate you are more likely to eat less. They think it has to do with the fact that red is also a colour that is associated with danger, warnings or stopping.

Therefore these are the four colours I am going to use in this project. The colours orange and yellow I will be using more primary and red and green I will be using too high lights.

## Icons

At the beginning of this project, I was not sure if I wanted any icons beside the hamburger icon for my mobile menu bar. As I went on in this build I found it visually better to add icons to the small and simple forms, like login and register. I used the icons from the icons library from Materializecss. The icons are easy to understand and they provide visual support to the input fields.

## Styling

The navbar is vertical on top of the screen. The navbar on a large screen is fully viewable. On smaller screens, it will present itself as a hamburger navbar whereas you click it the menu slides out. The Navbar is styled the color **#ff9800 orange** from Materialize. The text in the navbar is the colour **White**. I tried to give it the colour yellow, from Materialize, but that did not work. I have to say that I think it works the white text in the orange navbar. The text has some extra shadow so it will pop out of the orange navbar. The page has the colour **#ffff80**. As for these 2 colours, I choose them because they have a positive effect on your appetite. I choose to style the page titles all in H1 and centred on the page.

### home

The Intro section on the home page consists of the text Welcome to and the name of the project. Under the welcome text, I have placed a carousel with some of the pictures of the dishes that you can find on the page. The last part of this intro section has an h5 and it tells the user what the idea is of the website.

In the About section is an explanation about the idea about this website. The text in the home page is the **default black**. It gives some quite in the colourful page. I added a white box around the about section as this will make it easier to read for users.

### Recipes

I styled the recipes in card panel that has a reveal. So that the user just can the title, image and cookbook name on first glance at the card. The background colour of the cards is white. The background colour of the card together with the simplistic look of the front of the card should give the user a calming effect even though the very bright and loud background colour of the page.

The back of the revealed card is styled a bit busier as I had to add a bit more information to it. I decided the card into 3 sections to make it easier to read. In the first section, I put the name of the recipe again so a user knows which recipe card it has turned around. The second section tells the user more information about times and servings of the recipe. In the last section, the user can find a description of the dish with a button to open the hole recipe.

### login and register

These 2 pages are styled in a similar way to form layout

# Testing

## Testing by others

I asked some of my friends and family members to test my project. So would get some idea's of what I needed to fix or they would see something I didn't even think about. 

- Test user 1: 
    - **Issue 1**: The text of the "About" section is a bit too long, and it conflicts with the simple feel the rest of the website tries to give.
    **Solution**: I shorted the "About" text and put it in a white card to make it look similar to the rest of the page.
    - **Issue 2**: Cookbook field is too short, doesn't fit the simple I-can't-cook public.
    **Solution**: I removed the length restriction on the cookbook name field.
    - **Issue 3**: The user uses an iPhone to test the website. On the iPhone, the user can not register nor login to the site.
    **Solution**:

- Test user 2:
    - **Issue 1**: The user also uses an iPhone to test the website. On the iPhone, the user can not register nor login to the site.
    **Solution**:

- Test user 3:
    - **Issue 1**: The "Cook with me" in the top left corner should probably have more padding on the left so it's not so close to the edge. 
    **Solution**: I added a padding-left of 10px.
    - **Issue 2**: The text on the website had a lot of typos and badly structured sentences.
    **Solution**: I used the suggested spelling/grammar checker before realizing I have a Grammarly account. So the rest of the text on the website I checked using Grammarly

- Test user 4:
    - **Issue 1**: The pictures in the different recipe cards could use some top padding.
    **Solution**: I added on the top of the pictures the same amount of padding as the sides/bottom had to make to picture look more in balance.
    - **Issue 2**: The user thinks that the website could benefit from having a footer.
    **Solution**: As I don't have any contact to make a proper footer. I used the footer to show the following text: © 2020 Copyright Cook with me | For educational purpose.

# Bugs in development

## Resolved Bugs

- Bug 1
**Problem**: Profile page doesn't load, it gives a NoneType error
**Solution**: I gave my parameter and var the same name and that turned out to give the error. After correcting this my profile was shown but instead of the username, it was displaying the password. Turns out that I made a mistake in my login route. After checking the password it should match up the correct username but instead of a username, I wrote password. When I corrected this mistake the profile page showed the correct username.

- Bug 2
**Problem**: MongoDb is not inserting the name of the cookbook, it inserted null.
**Solution**: The name in the registration form and in the insert route was not the same. So when I made them match the correct name of the cookbook was inserted in MongoDB.

- Bug 3
**Problem**: Second select field doesn't show in edit_recipe- or add_recipe.html.
**Solution**: I reused the code of my first select field but I did it t get_recipes- instead of add_recipes route. Correcting this made the second select field only work at the add_recipe.html. Ather writing this made me look at the edit_recipe route and saw I had to copy the code here too and this made it work on the edit_recipe.html as well.

- Bug 4
**Problem**: In the user Profile page I want to put all the recipes that, that user has inserted. But it is giving me this error: TypeError: 'Collection' object is not callable. If you meant to call the 'find_all' method on a 'Collection' object it is failing because no such method exists.
**Solution**: Turnes out I did two things wrong in the code in my app.py. first of all, I did not give my search to the different recipes a variable. Secondly, I used the wrong variable in my return statement. In the code, in the profile.html I misunderstood how the for loop works. After changing all these things my data was presented on the profile.

- Bug 5
**Problem**: After clicking on the open recipe button on a recipe card. It would not present the whole recipe.
**Solution**: I used the same code to set up my recipe card as on the recipes page. I was told on Slack that it doesn't have to be in a for loop as I only need one. So after changing that the different recipes got presented.

- bug 6
**Problem**: The welcome flash text does not display the username
**Solution**: With the help of a tutor I found out that was down to a syntax error. I wrote a comma(,) instead it had to be a point(.). 

## Remaining bugs

- bug 7
**Problem**: When a user tries to use an iPhone they can not log in or register on the page.
**Solution**:
